@ This is a code test done by Alireza Dezfoolian all from scratch for Dolliete Digital, It's incomplete due to the time limit, but if I wanna carry on with that and finish it off, I would:

1- Do all rows per design (some missed for now, but I made one of each important parts)
2- Do more test accessibility and using screen reader
3- QA and testing on different browsers and devices and make sure everything is running smoothly (just look at it on Chrome and FireFox)
4- Design all images
5- Clean up the code
6- Make sure all spacing would look absolutely great on all devices
7- Make sure all linked to right locations
